      <h4>Rules & Format</h4>
			<div class="boxed">
				<p>You must play all six rounds to be eligible to win the King Classic and have your name on the trophy. The winner will have the lowest <b>net score</b> over six rounds.</p>
	      <p>The highest score you can card is +8 on a hole. Putt everything out and play everything down. All standard rules apply, including the local rule that allows you to drop and take a two-stroke penalty anywhere perpendicular to where a ball is lost or crossed the out of bounds line. Check out <b><a href="https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules-hub/rules-modernization/major-changes/golfs-new-rules-stroke-and-distance.html" target="_blank">this video</a></b> for a more thorough explanation of the rule.</p>
				<p>Initial handicaps must be verified, but do not need to be official. If you do not have a GHIN, there are several free apps that will calculate a handicap for you. <b><a href="https://www.thegrint.com/" target="_blank">The Grint</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.swingbyswing.com/" target="_blank">Swing by Swing</a></b> are a few good ones.</p>
				<p>Handicaps will <b>not</b> be adjusted based on performance during the trip. Rather, a course handicap is calculated for each round based on your initial index and the course rating and slope of the tees you elect to play. A course handicap is calculated as (H.I. x (slope / 113)) + (course rating - course par), rounded to the nearest integer. For example, if your index is 8.2 and you play from the Regular tees at Pine Needles (6,002 yards, 68.6 rating, 126 slope) your course handicap would be (8.2 x (126 / 113)) + (68.6 - 72) = 5.743 = 6. However, if you decided to play the Medal tees at Pine Needles (7,035 yards, 73.5 rating, 134 slope) your course handicap would be (8.2 x (134 / 113)) + (73.5 - 72) = 11.224 = 11. Each player will select the tees they wish to play from for each course prior to the trip. <b>Mid-trip changes to your selected tees are not allowed</b></p>
				<p>Please review each course scorecard and select the tees you wish to play. Send <b><a href="mailto: sdking49@gmail.com">Stuart</a></b> your selected tees by May 12th.</p>
